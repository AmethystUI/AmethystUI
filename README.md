# Introduction

AmethystUI is a semantic graphics editor that simplifies the design and testing of UI components, with the goal of making front-end development more efficient. This guide will explain how to install and develop for AmethystUI, and you may use the `â˜°` button on the top left corner to navigate through different sections.

# Setup
AmethystUI uses Svelte as its frontend framework and Rollup as its modle bundler. It also includes two live development server that's ready to use; One for the frontend application and one for the service workers.

## Prerequisites
Make sure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- Git commandline tools
- `SSH` and `GPG`
- NodeJS `v19.6.0` or newer
- `npm` and `yarn` Package Managers
- Typescript

## Security
We require that all commits made to this codebase to be done through secure tunnles such as `SSH` or `HTTPS`. If you wish to use `SSH` but not have it setted up, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) by GitHub. `GPG` signed commits are not required, but still highly encouraged. If you wish to set up GPG authentication, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/checking-for-existing-gpg-keys).

## Cloning & Installation
To install the codebase and development server, follow these instructions:

1. Install any missing prerequisites
2. Open a terminal and run the command that matches your system.
- MacOS / Linux SSH: `git clone git@github.com:AmethystUI/AmethystUI.git amethystui/ && cd amethystui/`
- Windows SSH: `git clone git@github.com:AmethystUI/AmethystUI.git amethystui\ && cd amethystui\`
3. Run `git pull origin` to update everything from Git
4. Run `yarn install` to install the necessary packages

The `amethystui/` folder will now be your working directory, and we recommend creating a VSCode project with `amethystui/` as the root folder.

# Development
The development guide in this repository will mainly cover the development environment, guidelines and rules for the **AmethystUI Frontend Application**. Any reference to "Amethyst" or "AmethystUI" will refer specifically to the frontend application of AmethystUI.

## Overview
All of the UI components in AmethystUI are built from scratch and follow a series of design guidelines. Do not use third party UI/UX components unless it meets all criterias of the AmethystUI design guidelines.

## Application Structure
AmethystUI's UI layout is as follows:
```
Main App
â”‚
â”œ Frontend
â”‚    â”œ Left panel
â”‚    â”‚   â”œ Editor selector
â”‚    â”‚   â”” Current view layer
â”‚    â”‚       â”œ Elements / Overrides
â”‚    â”‚       â”œ Component layers
â”‚    â”‚       â”” ...
â”‚    â”œ Top panel
â”‚    â”‚   â”œ New element
â”‚    â”‚   â”œ File name
â”‚    â”‚   â”” General app control
â”‚    â”‚       â”œ Canvas mode
â”‚    â”‚       â”œ Export
â”‚    â”‚       â”œ ...
â”‚    â”‚       â”” Account info
â”‚    â”œ Display panel
â”‚    â”‚   â”œ Element preview
â”‚    â”‚   â”” ...
â”‚    â”” Right panel
â”‚    â”‚   â”œ Bounding box editor
â”‚    â”‚   â”œ Appearance editor
â”‚    â”‚   â”” ...
â”‚    â”” Modals
â”‚    â”” Dynamic Overlays
â”” Service workers
    â”” ...
```

- **Main App**: This is essentially the entire AmethystUI application. Everything falls under here.

- **Frontend**: This is the part of the app that the user interacts with. It contains several sub-components:
    1. **Left Panel**: This panel contains the editor selector and the current view layer. The view layer is further subdivided into elements/overrides, component layers, and other related options. The contents of the view layer is also controlled by the editor selector.
    2. **Top Panel**: This panel contains controls for creating new elements, setting file names, and general app controls. General app controls include options like canvas mode, export, account info, and more.
    3. **Display Panel**: This panel contains an element preview and other related display options. The content of this panel is also controlled by the editor selector.
    4. **Right Panel**: This panel contains options for editing bounding boxes, adjusting the appearance of elements, and other related options. The content of this panel is also controlled by the editor selector.
    5. **Modals**: These are blocking popup windows that appear on top of the main UI to provide additional options or information, such as editing account information and export settings.
    6.**Dynamic Overlays**: These are floating, draggable, non-blocking modals that appear on certain contexts (such as picking colors or choosing fonts) on top of the main UI to provide more control over a certain attribute.
- Service Workers: These are separate threads that handle various background tasks. Currently, we only use it to fetch font files using the Google Fonts API and cache them into IndexedDB.

## Development servers

AmethystUI heavily utilize Service Workers to fetch data from remote servers, so it has two separate development servers that should boot up upon running `yarn run dev`.

To make sure both are running, make sure the debug message `Your application is ready~! ðŸš€` is shown twice. After the server has booted up, you should see a link from the development server that reads `http://localhost:{port-number}`. You may open the link in a web browser, and you should see the AmethystUI app hosted locally.
